Identify Elementor widgets that are slowing down page rendering and load times.

== Description ==

## How to use

When logged-in, go to any front-end page and click the "Widget Speed Test" button in the WordPress toolbar (the black bar across the top).

## More information

Page speed is such an important ranking factor, and has a huge impact on conversion rates. As a result, it's incredibly important to optimise page load times.

Sites built with Elementor make use of "widgets", and each widget gets rendered each time a page is loaded.

Sometimes a widget can consume more resources, which causes the page to slow down.

Widget Speed Test for Elementor helps you discover which widgets are slowing your page down, allowing you to make informed decisions about whether you should be using them or not.

We also hope that but making it easier to discover which widgets routinely cause pages to slow down, that we can help plugin authors and the Elementor team improve performance.

== Installation ==

1. Add the `widget-speed-test-for-elementor` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Who can see the results? =

Only logged-in users who are able to manage site options will be shown the speed test results.

= Can I hide the results? =

Currently the speed tests will always show whilst the plugin is active. In the future we may add the ability to turn it on and off at a user level.
